    During a school project, I worked on a campaign for Partout aimed at supporting "De Kindertelefoon," a Dutch service center helping children with personal and family issues. My role involved conducting <mark>extensive research</mark> to understand why children hesitate to reach out to "De Kindertelefoon." Our findings revealed that while 90% of children knew about the service, many were too scared to speak with them. To address this, our group developed a web game where children can create characters, style their homes, and visit virtual rooms of employees. This game helps children feel <mark>more comfortable</mark>  and reduces the barrier to seeking help. Below are some pixel art assets I created for this project.

    This project spotlights <mark>Ruby Mus</mark> , an emerging music artist and student from Rock City Eindhoven. As part of a school assignment, our team developed her branding (brandbook), orchestrated a photo shoot, produced a dance video and her website. I took charge of shooting the photos and editing the photos and creating a <mark>neon effect</mark> to the dance video using After Effects.

    Souraiko is a <mark>passion project</mark> between my friend and me, where every piece of clothing, sticker, accessory, and figure is selfmade with care and creativity. Our designs are unique, reflecting our love for streetwear and the planet. We strive to produce our clothing in the most <mark>environmentally friendly</mark> manner possible. Our latest venture involves creating 3D characters with AR codes and spreading them across cities. By scanning the QR code, you can claim the artwork on our site, earning discounts or becoming part of our community. It's like a geo hunt, blending fashion with interactive tech!
